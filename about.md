# Hey, I'm Hendrik!

I'm a data and software engineer **building systems** at the intersection of **large-scale data management** and **machine learning**.
Currently, I work as a Data Engineer at SiaSearch, where we create a data management platform for unstructured sensor data. 
I am involved in most of our backend and data infrastructure, from data ingestion, over data management and cataloging, to **building a scalable query engine** and backend. 

Previously, I completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science at [TU Berlin](https://www.tu-berlin.de) with a focus on **databases**, **large-scale data processing**, and **machine learning**.
During this time, I worked as a student researcher at the [DIMA Group at TU Berlin](https://www.dima.tu-berlin.de) and later at the [DES Group at HPI](https://hpi.de/rabl/home.html). 
My thesis was on **rethinking message brokers to leverage remote direct memory access and persistent memory**, and part of this work was awarded **2nd place** in the Graduate Student category at the [ACM SIGMOD 2020 Student Research Competition](https://src.acm.org/winners/2020).
Even before my studies, I was a **data scientist/engineer** at [Project A Ventures](https://www.project-a.com) where I designed, implemented, and extended data warehouses, large data processing pipelines as well as data products built on top of those.
I collaborated with startups in very different stages, ranging from pre-seed to established companies with a 500+MM USD valuation.

Feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:hendrik@makait.com "hendrik@makait.com") if you work on a compelling idea, company or open-source project in the space of **large-scale data management** and **machine learning**, or just want to have chat!
