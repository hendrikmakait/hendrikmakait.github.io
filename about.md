# About

Hendrik Makait is a data and software engineer building systems at the intersection of large-scale data management and machine learning.
Currently, he works as an Open Source Engineer at <a href="https://www.coiled.io/">Coiled</a> maintaining and improving <a href="https://www.dask.org/">Dask</a> and its distributed execution engine.
His focus areas include P2P shuffling which allows shuffling large data at constant memory, and observability with Dask to help users understand and optimize their workloads.

Previously, he has worked on scalable data management for multimodal and unstructured sensor data, as well as data engineering for business intelligence. He worked on the design and implementation of a scalable query engine at SiaSearch (acquired by <a href="https://scale.com/">Scale AI</a>), and later scaling the ingestion and querying capabilities of <a href="https://scale.com/nucleus">Scale Nucleus</a>. 
Before that, we was a data engineer at [Project A](https://www.project-a.com) working companies ranging from pre-seed startups to established marketplaces with 500+MM USD valuations to design, implement, and improve their data analytics capabilities.

While doing his M.Sc in Computer Science at [TU Berlin](https://www.tu-berlin.de), he did research on data management with modern hardware at thea [DIMA Group at TU Berlin](https://www.dima.tu-berlin.de) and later at the [DES Group at HPI](https://hpi.de/rabl/home.html). 
He wrote his thesis on rethinking message brokers to leverage remote direct memory access and persistent memory, and his research was awarded 2nd place in the Graduate Student category at the [ACM SIGMOD 2020 Student Research Competition](https://src.acm.org/winners/2020).
