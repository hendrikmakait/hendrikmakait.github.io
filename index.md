# Hey, Iâ€™m Hendrik!

I am a software and data engineer building systems at the intersection of large-scale data management and machine learning.
Most recently, I worked as an Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.coiled.io/">Coiled</a> maintaining and improving <a href="https://www.dask.org/">Dask</a> and its distributed execution engine.

I'm always interested in chatting about the Python and Rust data ecosystems, new trends in data/AI engineering, and data/AI system architecture. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:hendrik@makait.com "hendrik@makait.com") if you work on a compelling idea, company or open-source project, or just want to have chat!
